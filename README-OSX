### Creating a signing identity

See Chapter 2, "Obtaining a Signing Identity" of the Code Signing Guide:

http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/index.html

Add your certificate to the System keychain. Modify the trust settings as follows to "Never Trust" for all uses except for code signing, which should be "Always Trust."

### Signing gdb after building
